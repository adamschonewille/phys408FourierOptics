### Optical Set-up, Magnification Observations and Wire Mesh Experiments:

Mesh that we used has 40 lines/cm

Moving the collimator lens does not effect magnification or focus. It does seem to vary the intensity on the outer edges of the circle. 

We placed the spatial filter at the following settings:
Image plane
147.5+358.2+4.2
1.3-167
Absolute means from the start of measurement rail, offsets are already included in reported distances. Raw measurements are taken from the back of the stage and the offsets correct to the middle of the optical apparatus. 

For ease of reconstruction:
| Object | Set-up Distance at back of rail slider (cm)|
|--|--|
|Spatial Filter|33.3|
|Transform Lens|167|
|Mesh|108.5|
|Collimating Lens|55.8|
|Imaging Lens|265.5|
|Object Plane from knife edge|107.1|


The distances from the back of several objects to the center of the lenses/apertures is recorded for relative measurements. This was  the set-up distances can be related to the locations of action and used in the calculations later on. 

| Object | Offset Distances (cm)|
|--|--|
|Spatial Filter Offset ($\Delta$)|11.5|
|Transform Lens back offset ($\Delta$)|1.3|
|Mesh Offset ($\Delta$)|3.2|
|Collimating Lens Offset ($\Delta$)|3.05|
|Imaging Lens Offset ($\Delta$)|3.5|

Doing all these calculations gives the true locations of all the components in this optical setup:
| Object | Absolute Distance for calculations (cm)|
|--|--|
|Spatial Filter|$44.8 \pm 0.5$|
|Transform Lens|$168.3 \pm 0.5$|
|Image Plane|$509.9 \pm 0.5$|
|Mesh|$111.7 \pm 0.1$|
|Collimating Lens|$58.85 \pm 0.1$|
|Object Plane from knife edge| 107.1 |

### Character Recognition, Phase-Contrasting and Diffraction:

### Character Recognition:

In todays experiments we placed a sheet of grid paper onto the image plane to be able to see the difference in skew that the camera has on the image plane. This is because the camera views the image plane at an angle and so the bottom of the field of view is smaller than the top. First we set up the optical rail as follows to view the NOZON object in the image plane:
- **Experimental set-up:** 
- Collimating Lens
- NOZON aperture in object plane
- Fourier Transform Lens

We were able to get a clear image of the NOZON aperture:
![NOZON image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akshivbansal/phys408FourierOptics/master/raw_data_from_day2_20180313/Charecter%20Recognition/snap-unknown-20180313-114640-1.jpeg)

We can also invert the image to get a clearer image:
![INVERTED NOZON IMAGE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akshivbansal/phys408FourierOptics/master/raw_data_from_day2_20180313/Charecter%20Recognition/snap-unknown-20180313-114640-1-INVERTED.jpg)

We attempted to adjust the gain so that the image can be seen against the grid of paper to view the camera skew:

Next we added the Imagining lens into the set up to view the fourier transform:
- **Experimental set-up:** 
- Collimating Lens
- NOZON aperture in object plane
- Fourier Transform Lens
- Imaging Lens to see the FT of the NOZON object

Can also invert the image to save on ink and see more clearly what is going on:

The FT of the NOZON aperture looks similar to an asterisk (*) and in order to 

Next we put the Lazy X in

Again we invert the image:
