### Optical Set-up, Magnification Observations and Wire Mesh Experiments:

Mesh that we used has 40 lines/cm

Moving the collimator lens does not effect magnification or focus. It does seem to vary the intensity on the outer edges of the circle. 

We placed the spatial filter at the following settings:
Image plane
147.5+358.2+4.2
1.3-167
Absolute means from the start of measurement rail, offsets are already included in reported distances. Raw measurements are taken from the back of the stage and the offsets correct to the middle of the optical apparatus. 

For ease of reconstruction:
| Object | Set-up Distance at back of rail slider (cm)|
|--|--|
|Spatial Filter|33.3|
|Transform Lens|167|
|Mesh|108.5|
|Collimating Lens|55.8|
|Imaging Lens|265.5|
|Object Plane from knife edge|107.1|


The distances from the back of several objects to the center of the lenses/apertures is recorded for relative measurements. This was  the set-up distances can be related to the locations of action and used in the calculations later on. 

| Object | Offset Distances (cm)|
|--|--|
|Spatial Filter Offset ($\Delta$)|11.5|
|Transform Lens back offset ($\Delta$)|1.3|
|Mesh Offset ($\Delta$)|3.2|
|Collimating Lens Offset ($\Delta$)|3.05|
|Imaging Lens Offset ($\Delta$)|3.5|

Doing all these calculations gives the true locations of all the components in this optical setup:
| Object | Absolute Distance for calculations (cm)|
|--|--|
|Spatial Filter|$44.8 \pm 0.5$|
|Transform Lens|$168.3 \pm 0.5$|
|Image Plane|$509.9 \pm 0.5$|
|Mesh|$111.7 \pm 0.1$|
|Collimating Lens|$58.85 \pm 0.1$|
|Object Plane from knife edge| 107.1 |
