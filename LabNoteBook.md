### Magnification and shit:



Mesh that we used has 40 lines/cm

Moving the collimator lens does not effect magnification or focus. It does seem to vary the intensity on the outer edges of the circle. 

We placed the spatial filter at the following settings:
Image plane
147.5+358.2+4.2
1.3-167
Absolute means from the start of measurement rail, offsets are already included in reported distances.
| Object | Absolute Distance(cm)|
|--|--|
|Spatial Filter|44.8|
|Spatial Filter Offset|11.5|
|Transform Lens|168.3 pm 0.5|
|Transform Lens back offset|1.3|
|Image Plane|509.9 pm 0.5|
|Mesh|108.5|
||3.2|
|Collomating Lens|58.85 pm 0.1|
|Collimating Lens Offset|3.05|
